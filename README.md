The market is growing dynamically and sales Director is facing issues in tracking sales in this dynamic market.
He has regional managers for North India, South India and Central India.Overall the sales are declining and he is not able to find out the exact cause of this.When he asks for Insights the regional managers are not able to describe the whole scenario and they tries to convince the him that everything is good from our side and when Sales Director wants to know the reason behind it they gave them 69 excel files.So if we had a live interactive Dashboard may be we able to detect in which areas we needs improvement and maybe we can give them some promotional offers and create a better engagement with customers.
